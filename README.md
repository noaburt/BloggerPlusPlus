# BloggerPlusPlus

This was my genius (and totally original) idea for properly learning C++. The project is roughly based on the [Coding Challenges - Build your own Blogging Software](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-blog) challenge.

This is my first project using **CLion** as well, having used things like **Intellij** before it shouldn't be too bad.
